# S1 experimental sdk source

Experimental S1/T9000 transport, state and media source.

**Version `0.2.1-s1.experimental.6` corresponding source is published.** Read [EXPERIMENTAL.md](EXPERIMENTAL.md) for qualification evidence, known limitations and privacy requirements before using this source.

This is an independently maintained experimental branch derived from the [upstream project](https://github.com/mega-yfue/eufy-sdk) and [danymexi's S1 work](https://github.com/danymexi/eufy-sdk). It is not an official upstream release. Upstream copyright and license notices are preserved.

## Experimental.6 source delivery, 2026-10-18

Version `0.2.1-s1.experimental.6` corresponding source is published. Runtime and corresponding-source release: `https://github.com/genomez/ha-eufy-sdk-addon/releases/tag/s1-runtime-0.4.1.experimental.6`. The companion integration is `0.3.1-s1.experimental.6`, paired with add-on `0.4.1-s1.experimental.6`. Update both components; relay defaults to false and command keepalive remains 29000 ms independently. Only JSON boolean true enables relay. No npm publication is planned.

The accepted Linux amd64 image passed isolated smoke checks; this exact release has no claimed physical-device, live HA/HACS installation or overnight soak acceptance. Earlier dated preparation, dev3 pairing, source-preview restrictions and implementation qualification records below are historical. Current source is the accepted review.9 RC9 package; original licenses, attribution and modification notices are preserved.

## Development

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for source practices. Packages are delivered as runtime prerelease assets; no npm package publication is planned. Retained upstream commands and version labels must not be taken as fork installation instructions.

Please report synthetic reproductions and source findings in this fork. Never include real device or account information. The source manifest binds the exact files in this preview.

## Experimental.6 release candidate refresh, 2026-10-16

The earlier packaging-only .6 preparation above is historical. This candidate includes two SDK fixes: a slower state refresh cannot overwrite a newer parameter update, and a freshness read can retry when an unchanged background poll supersedes it. The SDK bundle, source inventory and local package are rebuilt from implementation input `980f9a1`, including `a408a51`. Version remains `0.2.1-s1.experimental.6`. Original licenses and attribution are preserved; final runtime qualification and publication remain pending.

## Experimental.6 upstream-port package refresh, 2026-10-16

This local package is rebuilt from implementation `02afeda1846e01e07ba154c48fd8401564eb1fb5`, including the upstream power-policy adaptations and retained `a408a51`/`980f9a1` freshness fixes. Earlier package statements above describe historical inputs. SDK version remains `0.2.1-s1.experimental.6`, private with npm publication disabled. The rebuilt bundle, complete source manifest and offline tarball identify the exact local input. Original licenses, attribution and notices remain intact; final-image and hardware qualification remain pending.

## Experimental.6 package refresh, 2026-10-17

This replaces the earlier review.7 candidate with review.9 input `681efd9` (implementation `d4335b9`, on review.8 `f6a59d9`). Runtime source is unchanged. Includes bounded pending acceptance for eligible correlated floodlight late replies with authoritative correction, supported S1 camera sirens, standard doorbell ring events and faster demand-only live-view admission, alongside the battery stream fix and native relay. The add-on relay option defaults to false; command keepalive remains 29000 independently. Package versions are SDK `0.2.1-s1.experimental.6` and bridge `0.3.1-s1.experimental.6`. Earlier candidate status statements above are historical. Original licenses and attribution remain. This is local packaging; publication and final device/soak qualification are pending.
