/**
 * `eufy_life` DP param space — the tag ids a T8L0x smart light reports on its own realtime wire.
 *
 * These are **DP tag numbers, not cloud param ids**, and they live in their own namespace because the
 * numbers collide: tag `0xa3` = 163 means strip length here and battery level in the vacuum DP space.
 * The read-side meanings are also unrelated to the write-side tags that share the same numbers on the
 * outbound leg (`0xa1` is a timestamp there, power here) — device→app and app→device are two separate
 * mappings over one tag range.
 *
 * CONFIRMED two ways (2026-07-28): decoded live off a real T8L02's status reports, matching the app's
 * own `deviceInfoPayloadDataParse` transcription field for field. Each entry's DP tag and the app's
 * field name for it are noted beside it.
 *
 * Names match the `PropertySpec.name`s in `capabilities/smart-light.ts` so a value resolves to the same
 * property whether it arrives through this dictionary or the capability's own spec table.
 *
