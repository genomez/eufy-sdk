 * The schedules a robot vacuum holds — `TimerResponse` on DP 164, decoded.

 * The DP number comes from a `get_product_data_point` dump; the product catalogue names the DP, and the
 * vendor's `timing.proto` carries the message.
 *
 * The shape is deeper than anything else on this line — a repeated `TimerInfo`, each with four nested
 * containers and a `oneof` for what the timer actually does — which is why it decodes here rather than
 * as one more field reader inside `vacuum-clean`. It reads a payload and answers a list; it never asks
 * the device for one, and it holds no DP number of its own.
 *
 * **`TimerInfo.Addition` is deliberately not decoded.** It carries the account ids of whoever created
 * and last edited each timer — the kind of value this SDK does not surface without a reason.
